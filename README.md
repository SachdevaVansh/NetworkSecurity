# Network Security Project: Malicious URL Detection using MLOPS
🚀 This repository presents a complete end-to-end MLOps project for detecting malicious URLs 🛡️ using XGBoost . It ensures user safety by identifying harmful links through machine learning. The project uses key tools and best practices to build a robust, scalable, and production-ready MLOps pipeline 🛠️. By combining data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring, it offers a full solution for both real-time and batch URL safety assessments ✅.

## INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT -
Malicious URLs are links that lead to harmful websites 🛑, often used by cybercriminals through phishing emails, social engineering, and other deceptive tactics 🎣. This project uses machine learning 🤖 to detect such URLs and offers both single and batch predictions through an interactive UI 💻.

## Dataset and Features

![url features](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b31f05db-528b-452c-a97e-0aa64319dcce)

The dataset contains **30 features** extracted from URLs, which help classify them as **Malicious** or **Safe**.

### Key Features

| **Feature Name**           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `having_IP_Address`        | Checks if the URL contains an IP address instead of a domain name, which can be a sign of phishing.|
| `URL_Length`               | Measures the length of the URL; longer URLs are often used to hide malicious content.            |
| `Shortening_Service`       | Detects the use of URL shortening services like `bit.ly`, often used to disguise harmful links.  |
| `having_At_Symbol`         | Flags the presence of '@' in the URL, which is sometimes used to obscure the real destination.   |
| `double_slash_redirecting` | Identifies if there are multiple slashes after the protocol, which can indicate redirection.     |

| **Feature Name**           | **Description**                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Prefix_Suffix`            | Checks for the use of dashes ('-') in the domain, commonly used in phishing URLs to spoof legit domains. |
| `having_Sub_Domain`        | Counts the number of subdomains; excessive subdomains are often used to make a URL appear legitimate. |
| `SSLfinal_State`           | Analyzes the SSL certificate; no SSL or a self-signed certificate may indicate an unsafe URL.    |
| `Domain_registration_length` | Measures the duration of domain registration; shorter registration lengths are common for malicious sites. |
| `Favicon`                  | Checks the favicon’s source; a mismatch between favicon and domain may indicate phishing.        |
| `port`                     | Detects if any unusual ports are being used, which can indicate malicious activity.             |
| `HTTPS_token`              | Flags the use of 'HTTPS' as part of the domain name, which could be a misleading tactic.         |
| `Request_URL`              | Checks if resources (e.g., images, scripts) are loaded from different domains, which may be suspicious. |
| `URL_of_Anchor`            | Analyzes the percentage of anchors (`<a>` tags) pointing to a different domain.                  |
| `Links_in_tags`            | Measures links found inside certain HTML tags like `<meta>`, `<script>`, and `<link>`.           |
| `SFH` (Server Form Handler) | Checks if the form action points to suspicious locations, which could indicate data theft.      |
| `Submitting_to_email`      | Flags URLs that allow form data to be directly submitted to an email, a sign of a phishing attempt.|
| `Abnormal_URL`             | Identifies URLs that do not match their domain, suggesting a discrepancy between URL and content.|
| `Redirect`                 | Counts the number of redirections (`3xx` responses); excessive redirects may indicate phishing.  |
| `on_mouseover`             | Detects if JavaScript `onmouseover` events are being used to change the link destination, tricking users.|
| `RightClick`               | Identifies if right-clicking is disabled, which may indicate attempts to prevent users from inspecting elements.|
| `popUpWindow`              | Flags the presence of pop-up windows, often used for deceptive ads or malicious content.        |
| `Iframe`                   | Detects the presence of invisible iframes, which are often used to load malicious content silently.|
| `age_of_domain`            | Analyzes the domain age; new domains are often used for malicious activities.                   |
| `DNSRecord`                | Checks if the domain has missing DNS records, indicating an untrustworthy website.              |
| `web_traffic`              | Measures the website's traffic volume; low or no traffic may indicate a potentially dangerous URL. |
| `Page_Rank`                | Checks the page rank of the URL; low rank could mean it is not a well-known or trusted source.  |
| `Google_Index`             | Identifies if the URL is indexed by Google; non-indexed URLs might be suspicious.                |
| `Links_pointing_to_page`   | Counts links pointing to the webpage; few or no inbound links may indicate a new or untrustworthy website.|
| `Statistical_report`       | Flags URLs reported for suspicious activity or listed in blacklists.                             |

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Fetched data directly from **MongoDB**.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff806462-7b17-48a3-bad1-cd6f2186a72c)
      ```python
      def export_collection_as_dataframe(self):
          try:
              database_name = self.data_ingestion_config.database_name
              collection_name = self.data_ingestion_config.collection_name
      
              with pymongo.MongoClient(MONGO_DB_URL) as mongo_client:
                  collection = mongo_client[database_name][collection_name]
      
                  # Logging to verify if collection has data
                  count = collection.count_documents({})
                  logging.info(f"Number of records retrieved from MongoDB: {count}")
      
                  if count == 0:
                      raise ValueError("No records found in MongoDB collection. Please check the data source.")
      
                  df = pd.DataFrame(list(collection.find()))
                  if "_id" in df.columns.to_list():
                      df = df.drop(columns=["_id"], axis=1)
      
                  df.replace({"na": np.nan}, inplace=True)
                  logging.info(f"Dataframe shape after exporting from MongoDB: {df.shape}")
      
                  return df
      
          except pymongo.errors.PyMongoError as e:
              raise NetworkSecurityException(f"MongoDB error: {str(e)}", sys)
      ```

   - Cleaned the data by replacing missing values (`na`) with `np.nan` and dropping unnecessary columns like `_id`.
   - Exported the processed data to a **feature store** for further usage.
   - Split the data into **training** and **testing** datasets, ensuring no data leakage.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Validated the schema to ensure all required columns are present.
   - Checked numerical columns for correctness and detected **data drift** using statistical tests.
   - Generated detailed drift reports to monitor dataset consistency.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Applied preprocessing steps, such as imputing missing values using a **KNNImputer**.
   - Prepared the data into transformed **NumPy arrays** for model training.
   - Saved the transformation pipeline as an artifact for future use.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Trained an **XGBoost Classifier** on the preprocessed data.
   - Performed overfitting and underfitting checks using metrics like **F1-score**.
   - Saved the trained model along with its preprocessing pipeline as a **pickle file**.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compared the new model with the existing deployed model (if available).
   - Evaluated metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** using **MLflow** for tracking.
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33bd60a6-41c5-4d28-9bb2-d3006db91070)
     
     - While the model shows signs of overfitting, the primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline.
      Model optimization can be addressed as a future enhancement.

   - Ensured that any new model provides measurable improvement before acceptance.

6. **Model Pusher**:
   - Saved the trained model to the **"saved_models"** directory for production deployment.
   - Uploaded the model and related artifacts to **AWS S3** for centralized storage.
      - "networksecuritymlops" bucket is used to store artifacts and models
